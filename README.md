<h1>Neural Networks</h1> <date>16/09/2021</date>

This is the repository of my progress in neural networks. There are three different folders, each containing a different neural network:

The "colores" folder contains a neural network that determines whether a color is light or dark. For example: ("R": 0.25, "G": 1, "B": 0.55) Each number is multiplied by 255 to obtain the color value. In this case, the color is ("red": 64, "green": 255, "blue": 140).

The "discos duros" folder contains a neural network that classifies a hard drive as expensive, cheap, or reasonably priced. To achieve this, you need to provide certain characteristics of the hard drive, and the network will provide the information. Inside the "script-precios" file, there is a guide on how the values work.

The "tensorflow" folder currently has nothing implemented. In this folder, I will be documenting my initial steps with the TensorFlow library.
